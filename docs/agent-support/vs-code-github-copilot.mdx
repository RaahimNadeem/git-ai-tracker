# Using VS Code & GitHub Copilot with `git-ai-tracker`

`git-ai-tracker` fully supports both authorship and prompt tracking for VS Code & GitHub Copilot. To use `git-ai-tracker` with VS Code & GitHub Copilot, just run `git-ai-tracker install-hooks` to automatically install the [`git-ai-tracker` extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=git-ai-tracker.git-ai-tracker-vscode).

Click [here (opens in VS Code)](vscode:extension/git-ai-tracker.git-ai-tracker-vscode) to install the extension manually.

Note: we plan to deprecate the extension and migrate to hooks once VS Code/GitHub Copilot [implement them](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/254567).

## How it works

The `git-ai-tracker` extension monitors document change application heuristics that we've discovered in VS Code and GitHub Copilot. They are reliable, but we still hope to have a simpler hooks-based integration soon. Please upvote the [hooks issue](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/254567) in VS Code's GitHub repo if you'd like to see hooks become standard!
