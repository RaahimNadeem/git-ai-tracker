# Using Cursor with `git-ai-tracker`

`git-ai-tracker` fully supports both authorship and prompt tracking for Cursor (IDE and CLI agent). To use `git-ai-tracker` with Cursor, just run `git-ai-tracker install-hooks`.

If you'd like to verify that Cursor has picked up your hooks: 

1. Cmd+Shift+P to open Cursor command input
2. In the input box, type `Output: Show Output Channels`
3. From the dropdown, select or type `Hooks`
4. You should see in the logs a message like `Loaded 2 user hook(s) for steps: afterFileEdit, beforeSubmitPrompt` indicating that Cursor has loaded the hooks.

## How it works

`git-ai-tracker` adds hooks to your user-level Cursor Settings [`~/.cursor/hooks.json`](https://cursor.com/docs/agent/hooks). These hooks automatically call `git-ai-tracker` before and after file edit tool calls to ensure accurate AI authorship tracking.

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "afterFileEdit": [
      {
        "command": "/Users/you/.git-ai-tracker/bin/git-ai-tracker checkpoint cursor --hook-input \"$(cat)\""
      }
    ],
    "beforeSubmitPrompt": [
      {
        "command": "/Users/you/.git-ai-tracker/bin/git-ai-tracker checkpoint cursor --hook-input \"$(cat)\""
      }
    ]
  },
  "version": 1
}
```
